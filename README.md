# D7045E
This is four lab assignments that was done during the LTU course D7045E, Real-time graphics and computational geometry.

## Lab assignment 1
The task was to write a program using WebGL with a simple GUI that displays a 2D KochSnowflake for certain recursion depths.

## Lab assignment 2
The task was to write a program using WebGL with a simple GUI that implements calculations of a convex hull to a set of points and then divides this convex hull into triangles. 
Also implement a search structure that can localise a point among the triangles. When clicking on a triangle, it should change in color.

## Lab assignment 3
The task was to implement 6 classes for resources (Mesh, Material, GraphicsNode, MonochromeMaterial, Shader, ShaderProgram), a static camera, and a simple lighting model.

Use WASD to move the green cube, along with E that brings the cube backwards and C that brings the cube forwards.

## Lab assignment 4
The task was to build on lab assignment 3 and expand it with multiple geometric bodies and improve the lighting. Together these geometric bodies build up a 3D world where you can 
walk around in a FPS view.

Use WASD to walk around, Q to look left, E to look right, R to look up, and F to look down.
